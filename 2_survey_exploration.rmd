## Introduction

We'll be using an in-built data set from the MASS package. But, because the MASS package can be a bit problematic to install, I've provided the data for you. It's in .rds format, so we load it in using the `read_rds()` function.

For more info about the dataset, head to https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/survey.html

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

survey <- read_rds("./data/survey.rds")
```

## Exercise 1
Explore the data - what variables are in there, what variable types, how many variables and observations?
```{r}
summary(survey)
```


## Exercise 2
Round every numeric variable to 0 decimal places.

```{r}
rounded <- survey %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round,0))

```


## Exercise 3
Using the rounded dataframe you created in Exercise 2, calculate the mean of each numeric variable in the dataset. Use kable() to insert a nicely formatted table into your R Markdown document.

```{r}
num_mean = rounded %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "Variable", cols = Wr.Hnd:Age) %>% 
  group_by(Variable) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))

kable(num_mean, digits = 1)
```


## Exercise 4
Now make exactly the same table, using the pivot functions. Again, use kable() to insert a nicely formatted table into your R Markdown document.
```{r}

```

## Exercise 5
Students had initially expressed their height in either imperial or metric units, but someone converted everything into centimeters. Create a new variable, Height_original, which will show height in centimeters for students who expressed their height in metric units, and height in inches for students who prefer imperial units. 

NOTE: This one is a bit of a challenge. You may want to check out the `case_when()` function.

```{r}
Height_original <- rounded %>% 
  mutate(Height= if_else(M.I == "Metric",Height, Height*0.393701))
```

## Exercise 6
Create a table that shows the mean and standard deviation of height - in centimeters for students who used metric units, and in inches for students who used imperial units. Use kable() to insert a nicely formatted table into your R Markdown document.

```{r}
Height_original %>% 
  filter(!is.na(M.I)) %>% 
  group_by(M.I) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE), "Standard Deviation" = sd(Height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  kable(digits = 1)
```


## Exercise 7
Create a contingency table to see the relationship between exercise and smoking. Pivot your table to make it easier to read, and then use kable() to insert a nicely formatted table into your R Markdown document.

```{r}
exsmo <- rounded %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Smoke)&!is.na(Exer)) %>% 
  group_by(Exer, Smoke) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Exer, values_from = n) %>% 
  kable()
exsmo

```


## Exercise 8
Create a grid of Pulse histograms - one histogram for each combination of Sex and Exercise.

```{r}
pulse_hist = rounded %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Pulse)&!is.na(Exer)&!is.na(Sex)) %>% 
  select(Pulse, Exer, Sex) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Pulse)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Exer), cols = vars(Sex)) +
  theme_bw()


```


## Exercise 9
Create a new variable, Hnd.diff, that shows the difference in span between the writing and non-writing hand. Create a set of boxplots of this variable, with a separate boxplot for those who write with their right hand, and another one for those who write with their left hand.

```{r}
Hnd.diff <- rounded %>% 
  mutate(HndDiff = Wr.Hnd-NW.Hnd) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(HndDiff)& !is.na(W.Hnd)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=HndDiff))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(cols=vars(W.Hnd)) +
  coord_flip()

```
